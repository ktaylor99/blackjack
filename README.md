# Blackjack
A Blackjack application built following the guidance of Per Harald Borgen at freeCodeCamp.org.

## Current Bugs
There's a bug that will lock the player out of starting a new game or drawing another card after a certain amount of rounds. 
It *will* lock the player out if they draw two 10's, as there is no way to get Blackjack from that, but it will also lock the player out for arbitrary reasons that I cannot find the cause of yet.

## Things to do
- [ ] Fix that annoying bug
- [ ] Make player name and cashout functional
- [ ] Maybe add win condition?
