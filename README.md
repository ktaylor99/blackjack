# Blackjack
A Blackjack application built following the guidance of Per Harald Borgen at freeCodeCamp.org.

## Current Bugs
There's a bug that I can't find the cause of where the game will lock you out of starting a new game or drawing another card after a certain amount of rounds. 
It *will* lock the player out if they draw two 10's, as there is no way to get Blackjack from that, but it will also lock the player out for arbitrary reasons that I cannot find the cause of yet.
