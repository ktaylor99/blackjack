# Blackjack
A Blackjack application built following the guidance of Per Harald Borgen at freeCodeCamp.org.

## Current Bugs
There's a bug that occurs after the player hits Blackjack once. I have no idea how to fix it. The bug will prevent the player from drawing the two initial cards or drawing a third card. 

## Things to do
- [ ] Make player name and cashout functional
- [ ] Maybe add win condition?
