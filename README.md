# Blackjack
A Blackjack application built following the guidance of Per Harald Borgen at freeCodeCamp.org.

## Current Bugs
There's a bug that occurs after the player hits Blackjack once. I have no idea how to fix it. The bug will prevent the player from drawing the two initial cards or drawing a third card. 

## The Goal
The goal with this project was to further familiarize myself with some more "complex" Javascript functions. So, while it's kind of a buggy mess, I *did* familiarize myself with some more complex Javascript functions. I'm calling it a success, lol.
